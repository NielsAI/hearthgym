# Readme for the analysis dashboard

## Introduction
This repository contains a dashboard for analyzing the performance of Hearthstone agents. The dashboard is based on the `Streamlit` framework and is designed to be used with log files generated by the `run_game.py` script. The dashboard allows you to visualize the performance of different agents and compare their results.

## Requirements
### Packages
Start by installing the required packages if not already done for HearthGym:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration
The dashboard requires a configuration file to run. The configuration file is a YAML file that contains the following parameters:

```yaml
LOGS_FOLDER: logs/
TENSORBOARD_FOLDER: tensorboards/
DEFAULT_MAIN_FOLDER: default_logs
```

The `LOGS_FOLDER` parameter specifies the folder where the log file folders are stored. The `TENSORBOARD_FOLDER` parameter specifies the folder where the TensorBoard files are stored. The `DEFAULT_MAIN_FOLDER` parameter specifies the default subfolder with log files.

## Running the Dashboard
Go to the `src/analysis_dashboard` folder:
```bash
cd src/analysis_dashboard
```


Then, run the dashboard with the following command:
```bash
streamlit run Dashboard.py
```
